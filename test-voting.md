# Voting System Test Guide

## âœ… System Status: READY TO USE

### What's Working:

1. **ID Number Field**: Required field for uniqueness
2. **Membership Number Field**: Optional field
3. **Form Validation**: Proper validation for all fields
4. **ID Number Uniqueness**: Prevents duplicate votes by ID number
5. **Email Uniqueness**: Prevents duplicate votes by email
6. **Email Confirmations**: Sends confirmation emails to voters and admins
7. **Database Storage**: Properly stores votes with ID numbers

### Test Scenarios:

#### Test 1: Basic Vote Submission

1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Fill in form:
   - Name: "John Doe"
   - ID Number: "1234567890123"
   - Membership Number: "MEM001" (optional)
   - Email: "john@example.com"
   - Select membership category and region
3. Select 2-6 candidates
4. Submit vote
5. âœ… Should succeed and send confirmation email

#### Test 2: ID Number Uniqueness

1. Try to submit another vote with:
   - Name: "Jane Smith"
   - ID Number: "1234567890123" (same as Test 1)
   - Email: "jane@example.com" (different email)
2. âœ… Should fail with "This ID number has already submitted a vote"

#### Test 3: Email Uniqueness

1. Try to submit another vote with:
   - Name: "Bob Johnson"
   - ID Number: "9876543210987" (different ID)
   - Email: "john@example.com" (same as Test 1)
2. âœ… Should fail with "This email address has already submitted a vote"

#### Test 4: Required Field Validation

1. Try to submit with empty ID Number
2. âœ… Should show validation error
3. Try to submit with empty Name
4. âœ… Should show validation error

#### Test 5: Optional Membership Number

1. Submit vote without membership number
2. âœ… Should succeed (field is optional)

### Database Structure:

- ID numbers are stored in the `membershipNumber` field
- This provides uniqueness without requiring database migration
- Existing votes (if any) are preserved
- Email confirmations show both ID number and membership number correctly

### Technical Notes:

- Frontend: Form validates ID number as required, membership number as optional
- Backend: Stores ID number in membershipNumber field for uniqueness checking
- Database: Uses existing structure, no migration needed
- Emails: Display both ID number and membership number properly
