    name: "Deon Pastor",
    bio: "I am currently the executive chef at Southern Sun Bloemfontein. My culinary journey started at a busy private restaurant where my introduction to a kitchen was cleaning up after the chefs, washing pots and mopping floors. I eventually worked my way up the order to where I finally became a line chef. My real introduction to becoming a chef was during my internship at the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg, where I was exposed to exceptionally talented chefs who guided and trained me in the start of my career. I then worked in various hotels and restaurants for corporate and private companies. My career has taken me all over South Africa as well as a short stint abroad and during my journey I have met incredible chefs and phenomenal mentors who have kept reminding me that growth, humility and mentorship is a huge part of a successful career. I finally settled in Bloemfontein and connected with some awesome local chefs. I became the regional chairperson of SA Chefs and with the support of the committee, we connected with local chefs and have taken Bloemfontein from being an inactive region to a successful one. My passion is to bring back the camaraderie that chefs used to enjoy, to reignite and share the love and enjoyment of our industry and to remember why we became chefs. To mentor and empower chefs on all levels and to give back to our communities. This I believe is possible through inclusion, a shared vision and buy in from all stakeholders.",
